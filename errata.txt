TO DO:
    Site Manager Use Cases
        Remove Store
        put a button into GenerateStore__ to sort ascending or descending

Things to fix:
    1. screen w & h is > 100% 
    3. adding the computer (pushing the button) seems to log out store owner - goes to landing
    4. auto-adjust nav button width for N buttons out of the view (owner wraps)
    5. i broke the default store owner view :)
